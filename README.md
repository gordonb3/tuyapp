# Tuyapp

C++ hack to the Local Tuya API

## Description

This project takes a lot of its ideas from jasonacox's Python based tinytuya project.

Reason for redeveloping this in C++ is that Python is quite heavy on resources and that does not suit well with embedded machines.

## Examples

There are several (simple) examples included in this project that show how the library can be used. Feel free to use whatever you like from these sources to build your own project using this library. Run ` make examples ` to build and check out these examples.
